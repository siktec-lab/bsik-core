## About BSIK
BSIK is an unconventional CMS and Framework for PHP. It is unconventional in the sense that it is not a monolithic system, but rather a collection of libraries that can be used independently of each other. It is also unconventional in the sense that it is not a framework that you build your application on top of, but rather a framework that you build your application with and around. BSIK is based on a modular architecture, which means that you can use as much or as little of it as you want. You can use it to build a simple website, a complex web application, or anything in between.
Modules in BSIK are used to integrate new functionality, themes, libraries and more. Modules can be installed, uninstalled, enabled and disabled at any time. Modules can be created by anyone, and can be shared with the community. Modules can be installed from the BSIK Marketplace, or from any other source.
